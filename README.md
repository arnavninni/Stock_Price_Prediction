# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict stock prices based on historical data. The primary goal is to analyze trends, preprocess data, build predictive models, and evaluate their accuracy.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw stock data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into historical trends.
- Machine Learning Models: Implementing models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTMs for predictions.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance with metrics like MAE, RMSE, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical stock price data. It includes:
- **Date**: Date of the stock record
- **Open**: Opening price of the stock
- **High**: Highest price during the trading day
- **Low**: Lowest price during the trading day
- **Close**: Closing price of the stock
